# Utility Web Experiments ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of small experimental projects, demos, and utilities.  
They are organized in folders, each themed differently (visual effects, signals, encoders, etc.).  
Some are complete mini-apps, some are half-finished tests or prototypes.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder demonstrates a different idea or effect:
- **HTML/CSS/JS** demos for simple interactive visuals
- **Small utilities** like encoders / converters
- **Animation & style experiments** in CSS
- **Data files** for testing formats

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage
- Open `.html` files directly in your browser to run demos.
- Check `.css` or `.js` files that accompany each HTML page.
- Text (`.txt`, `.md`) and JSON files hold reference notes or data samples.

> Note: This repo is a work-in-progress, combining multiple small side experiments. Expect irregular structures.

## âœ… Next Steps
- Expand on existing demos with more detailed features.
- Add new visual effects and interactive experiments.
- Improve documentation for any utilities worth maintaining.
