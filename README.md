# Digital Treasure Hunt 🗝️

Welcome to the official repository for the **Digital Treasure Hunt**.  
Inside this project lies a maze of files, folders, and even commit history, where **clues are hidden in plain sight**.  
Your task is to collaborate, investigate, and decode clues to reach the final **flag**.

## 🕵️ About the Hunt
- Clues are scattered across this repository.  
- Each clue may be hidden inside a file, a folder, commit history, or even code comments.  
- Decoding one clue will point you toward the next step in the hunt.  
- There will be **real clues** and also **decoys**.

## 🔑 How to Play
1. Start from this README file and look closely.  
2. Explore the repository structure thoroughly — open every folder, read code, and inspect comments.  
3. Use tools (like the included HTML converter or your own scripts) to decode **binary, hex, or base64 strings** you encounter.  
4. Real answers will guide you step by step toward the final flag.  
5. Beware of **red herrings** — false clues that lead nowhere.

## 🏆 Judging Criteria
- Primary: total number of riddles (stages) solved.
- Tie‑breaker: prompts per solved riddle = total prompts used / riddles solved (lower is better).

---

## Definitions:
- “Prompt” = any message submitted to an AI tool specifically to analyze/solve this event (riddle solving, Base64 decoding, synonym vetting, password reasoning).
- “Riddle solved” = the real folder for that stage was successfully unlocked with the correct password and the next stage was accessed.
